DIAGNOSIS
Here are examples of queries you could ask the NL2Kubectl Tool:
get the yaml file for the deployment called back in the default namespace
get the logs from the pod 123xyz in the complexdd namespace
get all the services in the abc789 namespace
describe the pod lol123 in the abc789 namespace

REMEDIATION
Patch the deployment "frontend-api" in the "production" namespace to update the image of the container named "api-container" to "api-image:2.0" to fix a bug.
Patch the deployment "data-processor" in the "data" namespace to increase the CPU request for the container named "processor" to "500m" to ensure it has more guaranteed CPU resources.
Edit the deployment "my-app" in the "staging" namespace to increase the resource limits for the container "main" to 2 CPUs and 4Gi of memory.
Delete the pod named "crashing-pod" in the "production" namespace, forcing Kubernetes to recreate it.
Execute the command `ls -l` in the container named "web" of the pod "my-pod" in the "staging" namespace.
